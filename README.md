### Hi there :blush:

My name is MÃ´nica Mota Ocariz from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2017, but before that I worked as FullStack Developer with Django and AngularJS. Now I work with ReactJS and my goal is learn more stuffs and improve myself ().

In my free time I like to spend time with my dog (:poodle:), to watch series (:tv:) - my favorite genre are historical asian series, to read books (ðŸ“š), to listen to music (ðŸŽµ) and of course go out with my friends (:pizza:). I love make new friends too.
