<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm MÃ´nica</h1>

My name is MÃ´nica Mota Ocariz from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2017. Actually I work with ReactJS and my goal is learn more stuffs and improve myself (:rocket:).

In my free time I like to spend time with my dog (:poodle:), watch series (:tv:) - my favorite genre are historical asian series, read books (ðŸ“š), listen to music (ðŸŽµ) and of course go out with my friends (:pizza:). I love make new friends too.
